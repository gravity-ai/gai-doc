# Purchasing a Model

Numerous models are available on Gravity AI's marketplace for purchase. Simply use the marketplace as you would any other ecommerce site. Browse and purchase to your heart's content!

## Credits

Many models in the marketplace require credits to purchase. Once you've purchased a model, you continue to recieve access to it as long as you continue to subscribe to the model (i.e. your credits remain allocated towards the model). You can cancel your subscription to the model and your credits will be refunded (note that credits may require up to 20 days before they become available again, especially if a license key was recently generated).

## On-Demand Runs

Upload and run your own model starting at $0.0001 per second (2GB of RAM). View individual pre-trained models for pricing details. Host your own model and run on GPU (coming soon).

## Licenses

When you purchase a model, you gain the ability to download the model as a docker container. You can also generate a license key for the container. These keys must be uploaded to the container before the container will process data. Keys expire every {{expiration.license.duration_in_days}} days, and may be generated and renewed as long as you maintain your subscription to the model.
