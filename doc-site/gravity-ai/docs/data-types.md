# Data Types

Gravity AI models support a variety of data types for input and output.

## Structured Data

This is well-defined data in csv or json format (support for more data types, such as xml, is coming soon). This kind of data adheres to a schema. Additionally, gravity ai allows data to be mapped from one schema to another, which allows your data to work with a gravity ai model without altering your data.

## Text Data

This is plain-text data

## Image Data

Multiple common image formats are accepted.
