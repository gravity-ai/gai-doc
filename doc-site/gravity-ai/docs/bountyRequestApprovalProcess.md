# Bounty Request Approval Process

gravityAI offers a powerful means for companies and individuals to request AI Solutions to particular problems.  By leveraging our platform, you will be reaching out to our sellers who will compete to fulfill your needs.  As you will be reaching out to potentially hundreds of sellers, you might need to ensure that your request is well documented.  You must know how to clearly define the problem you wish to solve, know your budget to solve this problem, and provide as many details as is necessary to solve your particular problem.

If your request is not well documented, not only will people not submit models to your request, but those few models that make it might be far off from your desired goal.  Providing test data, or at least the schema of data, will help sellers tremendously as they work to fulfill your needs.

In general, the bounty request approval flow might proceed as follow
