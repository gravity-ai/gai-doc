# gravityAI

## Overview

In a nutshell, gravityAI is an AI marketplace that provides containerized models to both enterprises and individuals alike. Data Scientists have the opportunity to market their models in our extensive catalog, and get paid for their efforts should a buyer decide to purchase them.  Buyers would stand to benefit from utilizing a containerized ready-made, low-code solution that could integrate well in their infrastructure.  

Because the buyer will be using these models in their infrastructure, we need to make sure that the models that sellers are provided are vetted and go through an appropriate approval process.  This process requires some small updates to your code, and a little back and forth on documentationâ€¦sellers might need an in-depth understanding of our build process and how to test and troubleshoot their models.

Buyers and Sellers are not the only ones that we support at gravityAI!  Should you wish a custom solution for your needs, you need only submit a [bounty request](./glossary.md#Bounty Feature)!
